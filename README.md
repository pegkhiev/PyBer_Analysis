# PyBer_Analysis

## Challenge Background
The challenge a summary table of key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the average fare for each week by each city type.

## Pyber Analysis Summary

The summary shows that Urban cities generate the most rides and total fares, and have the most drivers.  The average fare per ride and average per driver is lowest in urban cities.  The total rides and fares in Rural cities are the lowest, but the average fare per ride and per driver in rural cities are the highest.

The total fares over the period of 01/01/2019 to 04/28/2019 graph shows that urban cities generate the highest total fares throughout the entire period, whereas rural cities remain the lowest throughout the whole period.  

## Implications 

Urban cities were generating the highest total fares because there were the highest number of drivers available.  However, it shows that the lowest average fare per ride could result from shorter rides.  

It also shows that rural cities were lowest in total fares because of the low number of drivers available.  The average number of rides per driver is 1.6 compared to 0.67 per driver in urban cities. The highest average fare per ride also indicates longer distances per ride in rural cities.  Therefore Pyber would benefit from investing in more drivers in rural cities to generate higher total fares.
